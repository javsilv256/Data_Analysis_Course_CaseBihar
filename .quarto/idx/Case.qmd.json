The disease is known to disproportionally affect the poorest segments of society, this could be due to increased exposure to sand flies as a result of poor housing and environmental conditions.\n\nTo assess the contributions of different factors, a study team conducted an entomological **survey** in an estimated population of 2,000 and collected information on housing and environmental conditions as well as on assets owned. Some important information collected were:\n\n-   It was asked whether anyone had suffered VL in the past two years. All cases reported were verified from medical records by a study physician.\n\n-   Regular use of a bed net was defined as sleeping under a bed net at least 10 months per year.\n\n-   Data on ownership of a number of durable consumer goods at the level of the household was asked in order to create an asset-index .\n\n-   Information about belonging to the scheduled castes.\n\n-   Information on housing and on ownership of animals. Animals could either attract sand flies to the houses or divert sand flies away from humans.\n\n-   Environmental factors such as the presence of certain trees, water bodies and organic material.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"toc-depth":4,"reference-location":"margin","filters":["lightbox"],"self-contained":true,"output-file":"Case.html"},"language":{"title-block-author-single":"Writer"},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","knitr":{"opts_chunk":{"cache":true,"cache.lazy":false,"R.options":{"knitr.graphics.auto_pdf":true},"attr.source":".numberLines"}},"theme":{"light":["flatly","custom.scss"]},"fontsize":"16px","linestretch":1.6,"smooth-scroll":true,"title":"The case","custom_title_page":false,"lightbox":"auto","subtitle":"Visceral Leishmaniasis in Bihar","date":"2023-02-27","abstract":"The description of the case was taken from the exercises given in the Multivariate Analysis Course of the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp."},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","filters":["lightbox"],"output-file":"Case.pdf"},"language":{"title-block-author-single":"Writer"},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"editor":"visual","knitr":{"opts_chunk":{"cache":true,"cache.lazy":false,"R.options":{"knitr.graphics.auto_pdf":true},"attr.source":".numberLines"}},"title":"The case","custom_title_page":false,"lightbox":"auto","subtitle":"Visceral Leishmaniasis in Bihar","date":"2023-02-27","abstract":"The description of the case was taken from the exercises given in the Multivariate Analysis Course of the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp.","documentclass":"article"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
