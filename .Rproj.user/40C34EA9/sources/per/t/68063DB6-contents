##### Report of VL in Bihar

In Bihar, India, visceral Leishmaniasis or Kala Azar is transmitted by the phlebotomine sand fly p.argentipes. The disease is known to disproportionally affect the poorest segments of society, this could be due to increased exposure to sand flies as a result of poor housing and environmental conditions.

To assess the contributions of different factors, a study team conducted an entomological **survey** in an estimated population of 2,000 and collected information on housing and environmental conditions as well as on assets owned. Some important information collected were:

-   It was asked whether anyone had suffered VL in the past two years. All cases reported were verified from medical records by a study physician.

-   Regular use of a bed net was defined as sleeping under a bed net at least 10 months per year.

-   Data on ownership of a number of durable consumer goods at the level of the household was asked in order to create an asset-index .

-   Information about belonging to the scheduled castes.

-   Information on housing and on ownership of animals. Animals could either attract sand flies to the houses or divert sand flies away from humans.

-   Environmental factors such as the presence of certain trees, water bodies and organic material.
