These notes are from the Data Analysis Course (optional) at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp.\nThis case involves the data cleaning and data analysis of a dataset from a project in Bihar, India (funded by TMRC, Tropical Medicine Research Council) that was used in a published analysis on risk factors for visceral leishmaniasis (Hasker et al. 2012).\nThese notes were made as an extended reference for the solution script given by Tom Smekens PhD.
